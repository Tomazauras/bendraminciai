# how to contribute to CONNECT platform

there are multiple ways to contribute to CONNECT platform, but before that, if you are not familiar with it, please [checkout our website](https://connect-platform.com) and the [readme file](README.md) first. you might want to [read this](https://medium.com/connect-platform/the-problem-of-async-programming-and-a-crazy-idea-for-solving-it-cf368a9ea949) to form a more clear idea of the intention behind the project, and it is highly recommended to to checkout [our guides](https://medium.com/connect-platform/guides/home) and [try the platform](https://deskfront.connect-platform.com/), if you haven't already.

Here are the main ways to contribute to CONNECT platform:

## feedback

CONNECT platform is built for developers, so an extremely important but also extremely easy thing you can do is to [give it a try](https://deskfront.connect-platform.com/) and give us feedback, either via [this discord server](https://discordapp.com/invite/WfdyDBe), creating issues, [dropping us an email](mailto:eugene@connect-platform.com), etc.

if you want to set it up on your own machines for trying it, [check this guide out](https://medium.com/connect-platform/how-to-setup-connect-platform-d82d49e029ee). 

## packages

although all javascript packages are usable on CONNECT platform, it is more convinient to have _CONNECT packages_ as then you would be truly exploiting the potential of the platform. developing such packages is extremely easy, and if you wish to do so, [here is a guide for you](https://medium.com/connect-platform/how-to-write-a-connect-platform-package-b903bb9d9fbb).

if you are more of a hands-on kind of person who prefers to code and read other codes instead of guides and docs, we've got you covered as well. just [take a look at this repo](https://github.com/CONNECT-platform/connect-platform-package-boilerplate) for a start, and perhaps [repos like this](https://github.com/loreanvictor/connect-jwt) or [this one](https://github.com/loreanvictor/connect-firestore) as for nice examples.

you can develop any packages that you choose to, however, packages in the following domains would be most helpful to us ATM:

* SDKs for popular (web) services, think MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Telegram Bot API, Kafka, etc. 
* wrappers for popular backend Node.js packages

when you are done with your package, do not forget to [submit a pull request to this repo](https://github.com/CONNECT-platform/connect-repo) so that it can be showcased to anyone utilizing CONNECT platform.

## issues

this comes without saying, but as with any other open-source project, it is really appreciated if you could [checkout the currently open issues](https://github.com/CONNECT-platform/connect-platform/issues) and create according pull requests, or add issues of your own.
